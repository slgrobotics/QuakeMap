QuakeMap is a mapping program for hikers, geocachers and other GPS users. It helps you draw your route, prints detailed aerial and topo maps and overlays waypoints (including geocaches) on the map. QuakeMap loads track logs from GPS and helps you analyze them. 

QuakeMap is designed for user convenience. It features intuitive user interface, displays aerial and topo maps from Terraserver-USA.com, supports most popular Garmin and Magellan receivers, reads and writes GPX files and makes viewing your GPS data easy. Most functions are just one click away, and waypoints data conveniently shows in small pop-ups as you hover the mouse over the map. 

QuakeMap keeps original data links and allows you to make your own. Waypoints can be associated with web links, so that clicking on them will bring up the browser. This way geocaches and earthquakes allow instant drill down to original data page, and trackpoints can be linked to your data.

The program requires at least a 1GHz / 128Mb Windows 98/2000/XP computer, with .NET Framework installed (free download from Microsoft.com). Internet connection is required, but if you once visited the area the maps will be stored on the hard drive and QuakeMap will work offline. 

Exclusive features include:

- Geocaching Pocket Query support. QuakeMap reads Pocket queries in GPX format and displays detailed information on the map.

- Annotated trips. You can edit GPS track logs and associate web links with selected trackpoints. These points become visible links on the map - clicking on them brings up the browser with associated web page or picture. If you have your photo collection on the Web, make a track log with your comments and links to the pictures and share your trip with your friends.

- Earthquake information from USGS overlayed on maps. QuakeMap collects data from USGS public sources and shows you recent earthquakes on the map, table and a graph.

- Relief maps - where aerial maps are not available, color relief maps will be displayed. You can zoom out to World map level, zoom in any part of the world.

- Persistent files - you can designate selected files to load on start, so that your data shows up when you start the program.

GPS receivers supported:

tested with Magellan SporTrack Pro, Garmin eTrex Vista, GPS-V. QuakeMap should work with most Garmin and Magellan devices, and with any NMEA capable unit for tracking current position. 

File formats:

GPX files, Geocaching .loc files, Pocket Queries. Fully compatible with EasyGPS/ExpertGPS files.
